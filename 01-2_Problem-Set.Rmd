## Problem 4 - Resume/CV

(Adapted from <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto>) Practice what youâ€™ve learned by creating a brief markdown resume (or *Curriculum Vitae*, CV). The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bullet list of job responsibilities, or relevant classes. Highlight the years in bold.
